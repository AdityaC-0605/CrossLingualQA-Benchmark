# Error Analysis and Language-Specific Insights

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of common error patterns, language-specific challenges, and insights from the cross-lingual question answering experiments.

## 1. Error Categories

### 1.1 Answer Extraction Errors

**Span Boundary Issues**
- **Problem**: Incorrect start/end positions for answer spans
- **Common in**: Languages with complex morphology (Turkish, Arabic)
- **Example**: 
  - Question: "What is the capital of Turkey?"
  - Context: "...Ankara is the capital city of Turkey..."
  - Error: Extracting "Ankara is" instead of "Ankara"

**Answer Completeness**
- **Problem**: Partial answer extraction
- **Common in**: Languages with different word order
- **Example**:
  - Question: "Who wrote the book?"
  - Context: "...The famous author John Smith wrote this book..."
  - Error: Extracting "John" instead of "John Smith"

### 1.2 Language-Specific Challenges

**Morphological Complexity**
- **Turkish**: Agglutinative language with complex word formation
- **Arabic**: Rich morphology with root-based word formation
- **Russian**: Complex case system affecting word forms

**Word Order Differences**
- **German**: Verb-final constructions in subordinate clauses
- **Chinese**: Topic-comment structure
- **Arabic**: VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order

**Script and Encoding Issues**
- **Arabic/Hebrew**: Right-to-left text direction
- **Chinese**: Character-based writing system
- **Thai**: No spaces between words

### 1.3 Cross-Lingual Transfer Failures

**False Cognates**
- **Problem**: Words that look similar but have different meanings
- **Example**: "actual" (English) vs "actual" (Spanish - meaning "current")

**Cultural Context**
- **Problem**: Questions requiring cultural knowledge
- **Example**: "What is the traditional food of Japan?" (requires cultural knowledge)

**Domain Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Training on Wikipedia, testing on different domains
- **Impact**: Reduced performance on specialized domains
